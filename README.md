# Whitelist Contract For Crypto Devs WITH LEARNWEB3DAO SOPHOMORE TRACK

This project demonstrates a whitelist contract where users can submit their addresses to be whitelisted so they can participate in the presale of our crypto devs token.

The frontend of this contract was built with NextJS that provides a simple user interface to allow users to interact with the contract.
Firstly, you need to connect your wallet and if you own Crypto Devs NFTs, you can claim tokens based on the ampount of NFTs your wallet address minted and then you can decide to buy more tokens for ETH. Also, users that dont have NFTs can click on the mint tokens button to buy the tokens at 0.001 ETH per token.


Try running some of the following tasks on the contract (hardhat-tutorial) directory:

```shell
yarn hardhat help
yarn hardhat test
yarn hardhat node
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

## Getting Started With The Frontend
